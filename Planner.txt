Plans for selection random exercises for a workout:

Approach 1 - Muscle Weighting. (Chosen for now)
Each muscle will have a probability out of 1 to be picked for the next exercise, if picked, next exercise will have to include the muscle.
Picking the exercise means all muscles involved are less likely to be chosen next time and other ones will be more likely.
This means exercises with many muscles involved are more likely to be chosen.

Approach 2 - Exercise Weighting.
It will be the same as approach 1 except it's the exercises themselves that have weighting instead. This means Exercises with many 
variation will have major bias (Eg too many pushups).

Actually approach involves weighting for muscle, exercise and category all combined - future self.
Works well if there is a good amount and balance of exercises.
Otherwise a little bit of bias is present.

Todo:
